# PokerBot-

PokerBot! is an interactive Texas Hold'em heads-up bot that applies a fully functional process, leverages Game Theory Optimal (GTO) ranges, and a Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm for frequency-based and exploitative decision-making. Simulates heads-up play with advanced GTO raise sizings and can be used on C++ compilers. Built upon existing highly hand optimized C++ poker hand evaluation library. The core libraries of pokerstove are being open sourced. The project is currently in the process of reviewing and publishing the code. As code is reviewed and code sanitized further commits will be added.
